          <h3>Event Management</h3>

          <p>
            Hotels use commissions to build long-term relationships with event managers and event planners and encourage
            them to use their facilities and services in the future. Onyx handled the commissions process and the
            payment back and forth between hotel chains and event managers. Onyx wanted to know if there were any
            revenue opportunities by expanding into the event marketplace. The Onyx executive team tapped Slalom to
            present a proposal regarding this opportunity.

            That was all the time we were given to do the discovery and design and present a business requirements document
            to the Onyx executive team. I had to carefully schedule every step of my user experience process right from the
            start. The key was to start with the outcome in mind. I then walked back week by week to figure out what Product
            artifacts we would need each week to get to the final deliverable.

              <p>
                I kicked off the user research by interviewing various users in the events process, including event
                managers on both the hotel and event side. I developed a set of personas and mapped each personaâ€™s user
                flow to understand where the pain points were.

            I realized that there was much overlap between the various personas involved in the event management workflow.
            I used a journey map to show all that information in an easy-to-digest, scannable way.

            To show Onyx what a possible solution could look like, I created a prototype in code using the BFF prototyping engine,
            a prototyping tool that I had developed to help my Product team ideate much faster than was traditionally possible (see
            Securus for additional information).

            Conclusion
          </h3>
          <p>
            This project was a pilot for Onyx to see if it was worth it to pursue it further. Onyx was in the commissions
            business; event management was completely new to them. My prototype and the BRD we included as part of our
            presentation proved to Onyx's exec team that there was an opportunity to expand beyond commissions and into the
            events industry. As a result of this project, Onyx awarded Slalom additional funding for a small development
            team to convert my prototype into a full-blown product.
