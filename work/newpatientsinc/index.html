                            One of the New Patients Inc (NPI) partners approached me about overhauling their brand and their website.
                            The company did not have an in house design team. They had not updated their brand in years, and it
                            had become stale.
                        </p>

                            In addition to the website redesign, the partners asked me if I could give their internal graphics
                            design team a crash course in UX design so they could take over maintenance of the branding and the
                            website once I was done.

                            I was working on the NPI project on the side while working at EZLynx. I had a limited amout
                            of time to work on the project, so I had to work quickly. For the brand, I wanted to start with
                            the logo and logo colors, and then establish the brand around that.

                            I wanted the brand to look professional and inviting, so after a lot of research into
                            different color palettes, I settled on a combination of an earthy dark green
                            (professional) and a vibrant orange (inviting).

                            For the font I used
                            Montserrat, a warm welcoming, humanist font.

                            The text of the logo is set in a shape that we called the flag. The logo was designed
                            to look like an arrow. By placing the company name to the right, the
                            logo gives the impression of forward motion.

                        <p>
                            I created multiple versions of the logo, including inverted versions for light
                            backgrounds, black and white versions for print, and logo only version.

                <p>
                    To get an idea of the scope of the website redesign, I navigated through the entire website and
                    build a sitemap.

                <p>
                    Browsing through all the pages, I realized that I had a huge number of webpages with a lot of
                    content on each page to redesign. I was going to have take advantage of as many shortcuts as
                    possible to get the redesign completed quickly and on time. I contacted the marketing team to
                    see what assets they had that I could use.

                <p>
                    The team had access to a huge library of icons that had a consistent look and feel. I would have to
                    updated the colors to match the new identity, but that would take less time than trying to recreate
                    the dozens of icons on the website from scratch.

                    Around this time, a graphics designer released a collection of her illustrations
                    for free for both personal and commercial use. There was an incredible variety of scenarios
                    illustrated in her artwork, and they were available in fully editable SVG. I could
                    mix and match the objects and apply the brand colors to create my own custom illustrations for
                    the website.

                            The website would be developed overseas by an independent developer, with whom I would communicate
                            via email. Based on my past experience working with developers across the world, I knew that I would
                            have to generate precise pixel-perfect mockups, and export out all the assets &mdash; icons,
                            illustrations, fonts, content &mdash; to ensure the developer coded the site correctly.

                            I was designing the screens in Sketch. Sketch at the time was known to have performance problems
                            when there were too many objects in a file or on screen. I had to work carefully and quickly to
                            ensure I could deliver the mockups and assets to the developer on time without Sketch crashing and
                            forcing me to redo the process.

                    A few weeks after I completed the branding and website redesign, I flew into Las Vegas to meet the
                    NPI team to give their graphics designers a crash course in user experience design. I compressed
                    the several years of knowledge I had in user research, ideation, usability testing, and validation
                    into six hours of concentrated learning.

                    New Patients Inc's partners and founders were very happy with the new brand. They continue to use it
                    to this day. The website redesign was one of the biggest design projects I had done at the time and
                    definitely the biggest website project I have worked on to date. And the marketing team was very
                    happy with the UX crash course I gave them, as it was far more comprehensive than what they had
                    expected and could have receievd in a day from any online course.
