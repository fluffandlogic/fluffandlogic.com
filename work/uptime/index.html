                    Uptime was a branding exploration based on the design work I had done for a company many years before. The company made
                    an autonomous network of nodes that could monitor and regulate the heating, ventilation and cooling (HVAC) system in
                    a telephone company's central office, where phone lines and cell phone lines come in before they're routed elsewhere.
                    It was critical that the central office never went down.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    The original company name, Commtech, was rather generic, and didn't
                    convey how important their role was in keeping communications humming. For the company name, I wanted to come up with a
                    name that would reflect their critical role, hence Uptime.

                    The TV show Mad Men conveyed the idea that brilliant branding decisions emerge from one brilliant insight by a hyper-
                    talented but eccentric individual. The truth is most branding requires lots and lots of iterations over multiple ideas
                    until the team and client can agree on something that truly conveys the emotion the team is looking for.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    The raised U with the underline underneath it came up after many many rounds of experimentation. It struck me because of
                    the way it subtly and symbolically emphasized uptime without the need for a tagline.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Once I had a logo and color scheme I was happy with, it was time to develop a brand guide for everything from full color
                    to black and white, as well as the percentage of each color that would be used in various implementations.
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    Finally, I tested out the identity on some surfaces (website and hardware) to see if the logo would work in a variety of
                    applications without problems.
