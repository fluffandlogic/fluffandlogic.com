                <p>
                    Call Sumo was the founder of Yobi, and a partner in New Patients Inc (NPI). He was impressed with my
                    work on NPI and asked me if he could a shift and lift of his website. He was getting ready to do
                    a new marketing push for Call Sumo and he wanted to refresh his website to get people excited about
                    his product.

                    Analysis
                </h3>

                <p>
                    When I was analyzing the website, I noticed the brand colors didn't go well with the logo. I proposed
                    a slight tweak to the brand to match the logo, and suggested a different font that would
                    complement the font used in the logo as well as match the feel of the new site. Call Sumo's founder
                    agreed and I made the changes as below.
                </p>

                <h4>
                    Brand and Logo
                </h4>

                <p>
                    I matched the accent color to the color used in the Call Sumo logo. I then added a complementary
                    color that would pair well with the Coral Red in the logo. I chose Navy blue for it's professional
                    feel, as Call Sumo is targeted at upscale small businesses like dentists and doctors.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For the font, I chose Lato. Lato offers a balance between warm and professional, crisp and easy to
                    read.

                            Fixing the branding made the website redesign go a lot more smoothly, since I didn't have to manually
                            choose colors and fonts.

                    The website was smaller than the New Patients Inc website I had worked on a few months before this
                    project. It was a refreshing change of pace given my office workload was already pretty heavy.

                <p>
                    The Call Sumo redesign was one of the smnaller projects I've worked on. But even on this project,
                    like all my other projects I went above and beyond what I was asked to do, so I could deliver a
                    solution that the customer could be proud of, and that would be maintainable in the long run.
                    The brand guide would make future updates to the website and associated marketing materials such
                    as emails and social media campaigns easier and brand consistent so that prospects and customers
                    could look at Call Sumo as a high quality product and company.
