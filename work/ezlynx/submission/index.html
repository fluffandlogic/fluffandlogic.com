                 <h3>First Pass</h3>
                 <h4>Monday: I get blindsided</h4>
                 <p>
                     EZLynx hired a new Product Manager Maverick<sup>*</sup> to lead the Commercial
                     Submission project. The <strong>first problem</strong>:
                     <span class="hilite">Maverick had never worked with a product designer</span>, and
                     didn't feel that one was needed to launch a software product. My manager, Dean<sup>*</sup>,
                     the VP of Product had seen the positive impact I had had on the product team since joining EZLynx. He
                     insisted that Maverick work with me on this project. Maverick was not happy about this.
                 </p>

                 <p>
                     <strong>Problem #2: </strong> Maverick blindsided me with an unexpected announcement &mdash; he had
                     scheduled the project to go into development the following week! And he was telling me this on a
                     Monday! I asked Maverick if he could move the development date so I could have more time to work on
                     the designs, but he insisted that he couldn't (or wouldn't). I had <span class="hilite">less than five days</span>
                     to research, analyze, ideate, and turn around some mockups or wireframes for the development team!
                 </p>

                 <p>
                     Given the incredibly short time span, I had to plan ahead what I was going to deliver each day
                     (see below). I wouldn't have time to create mockups, so my final deliverable would be a set of
                     wireframes.

                 <p>
                     Long before this project started, there were plans in the the EZLynx roadmap to work on more
                     products for commercial insurance agents. I had requested and gotten permission to interview some of
                     those commercial agents. Based on those interviews, I had built a couple of commercial insurance
                     personas.
                 </p>

                 <p>
                     I was able to use those personas for this project.

                 <p>
                     I worked with two of my colleagues , DJ<sup>*</sup> and Reese<sup>*</sup>, who were business
                     analysts working on commercial insurance products for help with whiteboarding the flow since I
                     couldn't do it alone on such short notice. I then met with Maverick to review and iterate over the
                     user flows. I  then documented them as shown below.

                     I didn't have time to design any high fidelity mockups, so I put together some wireframes for the
                     development team. I had spent the previous year building a design system using Material Design as
                     a foundation and Angular Material as the component library in collaboration with the front end
                     engineers in the Dallas office where I worked. I knew that the team would be able to use my
                     wireframes to figure out what components to use and where.

                 <p>
                    I met with Maverick on Friday to go over the wireframes for Submission Center. I was proud of the
                     work that DJ, Reese, and I had done in such a short time. After showing the wireframes to Michael,
                     he had one last surprise for me: he wasn't going to use my wireframes. He was going to work with
                     the development team on whatever ideas he had already decided on before I started.
                 </p>

                 <p>
                     I was disappointed, but since Maverick was the product manager for Submission Center, there was
                     nothing I could do. I informed my manager, Dean. He was not happy either, but decided not to pursue
                     it further.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     I moved on with my other projects.

                <p>
                 A couple of months later, Dean called me into his office. Customers were <strong>very upset</strong>
                 with the Submission Center product that Maverick had launched. It turns out, the user flow and the
                 interface that Maverick's team designed were terrible. Dean was upset too. Maverick was finally ready
                 to work with me, and without the resistance he had shown the first time. And, I would have a lot more
                 time to work on the designs this time 😁. Dean wanted the design to be right.

                 <p>
                     I got some unexpected help from a colleague John<sup>*</sup> who had been researching commercial
                     insurance for a project he was working on. We met and whiteboarded the flow of documents and
                     artefacts between the insurance agent, the policy provider (e.g. State Farm), and the customer.
                     I was able to add the user flows below to the earlier flows I had whiteboarded in my discussions
                     with Maverick. I've included a sample of the user flows below.

                     I took advantage of the additional time to review my mockups with Maverick, my other colleagues in
                     product &mdash; including DJ and Reese &mdash; and the front end developers in Dallas to make sure
                     the designs I was proposing were feasible and usable. We iterated over the designs over a couple of
                     weeks, and I did some in-house usability testing to validate the flow. Finally, I reviewed the
                     screens with Dean to make sure he was happy with the new designs.

                     Note that Submission Center product itself is based on the EZLynx 5 design system which I had
                     designed. EZLynx 5 was based on Material Design. The core of the app (top navigation, left
                     navigation, and the left sidebar) were still based on the old EZLynx 4 design.

                    This project was one of many at EZLynx that demonstrated the value of user experience design
                     and product design as a valuable part of the software development lifecycle. We reviewed the
                     updated designs with our preferred customers and they were enthusiastic about the new design.
                     The new design gives users a birds eye view of all their submissions in one place, and helps
                     the user manage the tangled mess of lines of businesses, customer policies, and insurance
                     providers.

                     Submission Center went into production and was one of the first real products in EZLynx commercial
                     roadmap.
