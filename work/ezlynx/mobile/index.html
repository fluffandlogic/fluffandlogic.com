                <p>
                    The EZLynx web platform that I inherited when I joined the company was <span class="hilite">not
                    responsive</span> i.e. it was designed to work on desktop only. There was a mobile version of the
                    code, so engineers had to maintain <span class="hilite">two copies of the code</span>,
                    one for the desktop version, and one for mobile. It was becoming increasingly difficult to maintain
                    feature parity between the two. Over time, the mobile version had started to develop a lot of bugs
                    that made it harder and harder to update.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I spent over a year making a business case to the executive team to update the front-end design. I
                    presented a number of advantages including:

                            Once I got buy in from the executives and the development team, it took many more months of hard work
                            to build the design system. I used Material 2 as a foundation for the design system as it came
                            pre-packaged with a fantastic library of fonts, icons, and a beautiful color palette, and a deeply
                            researched and thoughtful set of guidelines on how to create an amazing customer experience.

                            teams, coordinating between 6 product managers, and building up a small design team. I was always
                            looking for any good design decisions that could save me time and help my team be productive.

                            that I had to tackle the designs for each breakpoint separately.

                            Shrinking the new EZLynx 5 desktop screens to  mobile ended up being a massive effort. A typical
                            EZLynx screen has dozens of fields. I had to make a lot of adjustments to the flow,
                            spacing, font sizes, and layout to fit them on a smaller screen, and ensure that the touch targets
                            were still big enough to reduce frustration.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    EZLynx 5 was the biggest responsive design project I have worked on. I ended up working with three
                    (and eventually four) scrum teams across two geographic dispersed locations &mdash; Dallas (Texas,
                    USA) and Bangalore (India).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I worked closely with the front-end team to ensure the mobile tweaks to the code were integrated and
                    tested thoroughly before they went to production, which happened just a month before the pandemic hit.
                    Despite launching such a major change at a very anxiety inducing time for our customers, I'm proud
                    to say that we had almost 97% positive feedback on the new design. I consider that a rousing success.
