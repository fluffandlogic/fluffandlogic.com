                    <h3>
                      About
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                      At EZLynx, I had two roles:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Individual Contributor
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Design Team Manager
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>
                      Individual Contributor
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                      The first was as an individual contributor on any project that had a user interface. In that role, I worked with the
                      Product teams and Developers following a designing thinking approach from concept to execution.
                    </p>

                    <h4>
                      Step 1: Kick Off
                    </h4>

                    <p>
                      Every product at EZLynx started either at the executive level or with a product manager.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Once a product manager had a high level scope, I met with them to understand their end goals or outcomes of the
                      project and learn what they already knew e.g. pain points, users, feedback on existing products, competitors, etc.
                    </p>

                    <h4>
                      Step 2: Discovery
                    </h4>

                    <p>
                      After this, I collaborated with the business analyst for the project to setup user interviews, so we could
                      understand the mental models and pain points as they existed at the time. I would then flesh out the user flows, personas,
                      context scenarios, information architecture, and functional hierarchy.
                    </p>

                    <div class="placeholder" style="background: url(/work/ezlynx/img/ezlynx-cert-user-flow.jpg) no-repeat center center; background-size: 99%; height: 380px;"></div>

                    <h4>Step 3: Ideation</h4>

                    <p>The next step was ideation. This was the fun part and could take the longest. At this point, I would start mocking
                      screens in UXPin using reusable components from the EZLynx design system. I would usually
                      go through multiple iterations of my mockups. After each iteration, I would review the mockups with the product
                      manager, BA, and front-end engineer for the team assigned to the project and refine the mockups based on whether
                      it wass feasible.</p>

                    <div class="placeholder" style="background: url(/work/ezlynx/img/ezlynx-policies.jpg) no-repeat center top; background-size: 99%; height: 380px;"></div>

                    <h4>Step 4: Usability Testing</h4>

                    <p>
                      During the ideation process, I would work with the business analyst to contact customers and get their feedback.
                      I would facilitate usability testing with the customer including setting up the usability test script, task list,
                      prototype/mockups that the users will use and anything else needed to complete the test.
                    </p>

                    <h4>
                      Step 5: Engineering
                    </h4>

                    <p>
                      Once the business had signed off on the mockups, we would review them further with the engineering team to
                      validate and surface any engineering concerns. Once engineering had approved the designs, I would continue working
                      with them through the development phase, giving my feedback during sprint reviews, or further iterating on the
                      mockups if the engineers ran into any issues that required changes to the mockups.
                    </p>

                    <h3>
                      Design Leader
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                      My other role was that of a design leader for the EZLynx organization. In this role, I worked closely with the
                      Product, Engineering, and Marketing teams to maintain the design system and branding guidelines that the various teams
                      use to build their deliverables.
                    </p>

                    <h4>
                      Product
                    </h4>

                    <p>
                      When I joined EZLynx there hadn’t been a UX person in the company in 2 years. The company had no design culture.
                      Consistency and discoverability were huge problems. I had joined EZLynx with the hope of building a UX team and
                      doing more user research and usability testing.</p>

                    <p>
                      However, before I could do that, I had to establish rapport with
                      the various teams. I had to build trust with Product and Engineering and convince them that I was their partner
                      in solving the challenges they were running into and I wasn’t just there to draw mockups.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      I started by applying the UX process to my organization. I interviewed stakeholders in the Product and
                      Development team, including BAs, project managers, developers, and more. I then did an audit of the existing
                      application and built an inventory of all existing controls, sitemap of the entire app, and the existing user
                      flow. I then built a roadmap that would help me build a foundation from which I could then establish a design
                      centered culture.
                    </p>

                    <h4>
                      Product Team
                    </h4>

                    <p>
                      I started by consolidating the product team on one design tool, UXPin, creating shared libraries and reusable
                      components that the team could use to build a consistent experience, and trained existing and new members of
                      the Product team on how to ensure their designs were up to my standards.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      I hired, managed, and mentored a small team of UI engineers and UX designers to help manage the increasing
                      workload of projects. In my first year at EZLynx, I was easily managing anywhere from 5-7 projects in any
                      given week. Eventually, with a UX team of three, each of us managed between 3-5 projects each. In addition to managing
                      the UX team, I also acted as the UX project manager, and helped to manage the UX team’s project schedule.
                    </p>

                    <h5>Guiding Principles</h5>
                    <p>To help onboard new team members to the EZLynx way of doing things, I created a UX Field Guide that described how
                      we did UX at EZLynx, and the guiding principles that underpinned the EZLynx product design philosophy (see below).</p>

                    <p>
                      The product team lacked easy access to user analytics. They had to depend on IT or engineering to build custom
                      on-demand reports, and those reports were only available to the individual product manager. I wrote a business
                      case, evangelized for, and helped roll out FullStory as a user analytics platform that would allow anyone in the
                      Product team to easily view user analytics and understand how their products were doing.
                    </p>

                    <h4>
                      Engineering
                    </h4>

                    <p>
                      One of the problems with Engineering was that there were almost a dozen development teams scattered between
                      two offices in Dallas and Bangalore, but only one front-end engineer. Consistency
                      was a major problem. Developers would build new features and components even if there were existing components
                      that did the job, and each new component had a different look and feel and behavior from the ones that were
                      developed previously. As an example there were 6 different components to upload files into the system, when one
                      would have sufficed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      I built a design system for the engineering team and acted as an advocate for the front-end engineer to any
                      other team I worked with. I pushed for reusing existing components and an API-driven approach, instead of duplicating
                      functionality.
                    </p>

                    <h4>
                      Marketing
                    </h4>

                    <p>
                      The existing brand had become stale by the time I had joined EZLynx and was no longer adequate to handle the
                      new products that were being developed. I worked with the marketing team to completely overhaul their brand
                      guidelines and built a new one that was designed to be more scalable and work better with the product.
