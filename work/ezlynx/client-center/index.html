                </h3>

                <p>
                    Client Center is a mobile web app that insurance agencies' customers can use to access their
                    policies and other documents outside of office hours.

                <h3>
                    Background
                </h3>

                <p>
                    When I joined EZLynx, I spent a lot of time trying to build an inventory of everything that
                    EZLynx offered. I found out about the EZLynx mobile app, Client Center, completely by accident when
                    one of the product managers asked for some help designing some screens. That lead me down a rabbit
                    hole as I tried to find out more about this mobile app, and how I could try it out. Getting access
                    to the app wasn't easy. It took over a year to gather data on the app and get approval to make a case
                    to work on it.
                </p>

                <h4>
                    Establishing a Timeline
                </h4>

                <p>
                    For this project, I partnered with a close colleague of mine at EZLynx DJ<sup>*</sup>. We had
                    worked together from the day I joined EZLynx, and had formed a close working relationship.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Since this was a grassroots effort and not part of the executive roadmap, we knew that we would need
                    to get executive support to keep this project funded. Based on my experience with other similar
                    projects at EZLynx, if the project didn't get to development within 4-6 months, the executives would
                    interest, and we would lose our change to fix the issues with CLient Center.
                </p>

                <p>
                    DJ and I gave ourselves 2-3 months for the research and ideation phase of the project. That left
                    another 2-3 months to create a backlog, get the developers on board and start building an MVP, so
                    we could show the executives enough progress to continue fund this project.
                </p>

                <h4>
                    Setting Objectives and Key Results
                </h4>

                <p>
                    OKRs were a new concept to me at the time. I had been reading about how OKRs were used in Silicon
                    Valley to help teams achieve moonshots, and I felt like this was an excellent opportunity to
                    experiment with this idea. DJ and I deliberated and decided on the following objectives for key
                    results, <span class="hilite">for ourselves</span> and ways to measure our progress. This was our
                    first time doing this, so our approach was a little rough.

                <p>
                    We started by interviewing agencies that have been using Client Center. We asked the agencies if we
                    could interview their customers, but they were reluctant to do so.

                                Finding the app was difficult. The agency's customer either had to memorize a unique URL,
                                or go to the agency's website, and then find the correct button.
                            </li>

                                The app had a lot of accessibility issues. For example, the text was light gray on white and
                                difficult to read.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                The app offered a much more limited set of features compared to the desktop app.

                            <li>

                    <span class="hilite">Customer support is a key differentiator</span> for insurance agents. Agents
                    were afraid a bad experience with the EZLynx mobile app would cause customers to defect. Some

                <h4>
                    App Goals
                </h4>

                <p>
                    After analyzing the agents pain points, DJ and I came up with a <span class="hilite">set of goals
                    for the app</span>.
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The app should not require training &mdash; ease of use was first and foremost.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The app should offer quick and easy access to the documents that customers needed most when
                        agents were out of the office.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The app should be able to handle the vast majority of requests from customers but be smart
                        enough to fall back to the agent when necessary.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The app should be like a partner to the agent, offloading the pressure of doing support calls
                        for thousands of clients by supporting customers like a real person (virtual agent).
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    The order of the goals was from most important and simplest, to most difficult.
                </p>

                <h3>Prioritization</h3>

                <p>
                    One reason I chose DJ to work with me on Client Center is that as a product manager he had a lot of
                    feature requests from prior interviews with agents. In addition, DJ and I had a lot of experience
                    working with the various scrum teams at EZLynx, so we knew what the teams were capable and how
                    difficult it would be for them to develop certain features.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We grabbed a bunch of Post-It notes and quickly wrote down all the features that we had noted down.
                    I then whiteboarded a 2x2 matrix of Must Have vs Complexity, and we placed the features on the
                    matrix. This helped us prioritize the order in which I we would develop the features.
                </p>

                <p>
                    DJ and I took the features and broke them down into a detailed list of user stories.

                <p>
                    There was one last step before I could start mocking up the screens, and that was the user flows.
                    Below are a sample of the user flows.

                            Once I had the list of user stories and flows, it was time to ideate on the designs of the screens.
                            I went through several versions before settling on the final version below.

                        <p>
                            The designs below were based on Material Design 2. I had read the Material documentation and fallen
                            in love with the design principles behind it, and the abundant supply of resources, given my own
                            lack of resources and time.

                            Although Client Center would be used by multiple agencies, each with their own brand, I did not have
                            the time or resources to create individual styles or style guides for each agency. So I decided to
                            go with a neutral color scheme for the main app, with a splash of color for the primary, secondary,
                            and tertiary accents, and additional color on the home screen representing each insurance company,
                            something we could programmatically obtain from our database.
                        </p>

                    <div class="col">
                        <p>One of the app goals was "The app should be like a partner to the agent". With that in mind the home
                            page was designed to be as friendly as possible. We put the agent's face on the homepage to humanize
                            the app, and set the "Good morning ..." text in Roboto Slab, which I find to be a warm welcoming
                            font, in contrast to Roboto Sans Serif which is more business like and cool.</p>

                        <p>
                            The insurance policy cards are set in primary colors and are inspired by  Vignelli Associates
                            graphics design examples from the 1960s.

                        <p>
                            With the rest of the designs, I tried to follow the Material 2 guidelines as closely as possible,
                            deviating whenever they affected the usability of the app.

                    DJ and I iterated on the screens and we did a couple of rounds of usability testing in house to validate
                    the designs.

                    Client Center was one of the projects that was not on the executive roadmap. I took the initiative to
                    look into it and work on it based on the complaints I heard from customers and the lack of action
                    from anyone else on the product team. I had to work hard to get approval on the project, and I had
                    to learn a lot of new things from OKRs to prioritization to roadmaps. The end result was a vastly
                    improved design over the existing application, and a hugely improved and far more accessible and
                    functional user experience.
