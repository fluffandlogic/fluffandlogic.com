                <h3>Asset Management</h3>

                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col">
                        <p>
                            <span class="hilite">Assets are the things that an insurance company can insure</span>. They
                            can be as big as a building, or as small as an earring. When a customer comes to an
                            insurance agent they're typically asking for an auto or home policy. The customer may not be
                            aware that there are <span class="hilite">additional things</span> in their home or
                            commercial property that can be insured, or perhaps should be insured in case they get lost,
                            stolen, or are destroyed by a fire, flood, or other natural causes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the one hand, agents would love to be able to ask customers if they have other things they
                            want to insure. But the process could become lengthy and tedious. And it's possible that the
                            customer may not remember everything that they want to insure.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col">
                        <p>
                            What if EZLynx could analyze the millions of policies in our database using data science or machine
                            learning and try to find patterns between the kinds of assets a property in a certain area, or of a
                            certain type could have? Could we then prompt the agent to ask the right questions and guide the
                            customer through insuring their assets?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This would give <span class="hilite">insurance agents</span> an opportunity to
                            <span class="hilite">increase their revenue</span> from places they traditionally would not even
                            have considered, and it would give <span class="hilite">EZLynx a new product</span> we could sell.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This was the thought process that led to the <span class="hilite">Asset Management idea</span>. One
                            of the product managers at EZLynx floated the idea to me, and asked me to explore it further,
                            because they didn't know how to proceed.

                    I didn't develop any mockups for this project. The goal here was to see if it this was a
                    <span class="hilite">viable project for EZLynx to pursue</span>.

                    Lean Business Model Canvas
                </h3>

                <p>
                    During this time, I had been researching Lean Startup and collaborative documents that can help
                    teams see if an ideas can be turned into businesses. One such document that I wanted to try out was
                    the Lean Business Model Canvas.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I setup a whiteboarding session with a couple of business analysts I had worked closely with, and
                    together we went through the Lean Business Model Canvas exercise.
                </p>

                        <p>
                            For the next step, I asked my colleagues who I had worked with on the Lean Business Canvas,
                            and a subject matter expert who had <span class="hilite">previously worked in an insurance
                            agency</span>, and who I frequently turned to when I needed to deep dive into a complex or
                            obscure aspect of insurance that I couldn't easily obtain any other way.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Our primary persona was going to be a personal insurance agent, with an optional secondary
                            persona being the commercial insurance agent (optional because for commercial insurance,
                            there are local and state laws that specify the kind of insurance a commercial entity must
                            have, so asset management is not usually a problem).
                        </p>

                    <div class="col">
                        <p>
                            The problem we wanted to solve for was the <span class="hilite">What, Why, and How</span>:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                What is the goal of this project. (We had also answered this question during the Lean
                                Business Canvas exercise, so this was mostly to confirm that we were on the right
                                track.)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Why do agents need this tool.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                How could we potentially build this tool in the EZLynx platform.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            The most important part of this exercise was the "What Constitutes an Asset" section. This
                            was the hardest problem to solve without our subject matter expert in the room, as we did
                            ot have the decades of experience necessary to build a mental model of the variety of assets
                            that can be insured.

                <p>
                    The final deliverable for this project was a user flow to show where EZLynx could integrate Asset
                    Management and how agents could earn commissions, which is their primary revenue source.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once I had all of these artefacts assembled, I put together a presentation for the product manager
                    that initially proposed the idea, to show him how EZLynx could turn the idea into a product, and
                    how agents could earn revenue from it.

                <p>
                    With Asset Management, I was able to expand my interest in product beyond user experience and design
                    leadership into the business side of the product lifecycle. Many of the hypotheses we suggested
                    during the lean business model canvas exercise were validated in other projects that
                    implemented aspects of the Asset Management project. And I was able to use my experience on this
                    project to further expand my knowledge of and collaboration with product management.
