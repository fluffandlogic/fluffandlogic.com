                    About
                  </h3>

                  <p>
                    Securus’s Secure Communication Platform (SCP) is used by facilities to monitor inmate communications with the outside
                    world and to analyze the conversations for potentially illegal activity.
                  </p>

                  <h3>
                    The Problem.
                  </h3>

                  <p>
                    Features had been layered organically over the years without much thought to the user experience or performance.
                    Performance had slowed to a crawl. Users had time to hit search, go make a fresh batch of coffee, and take their time
                    coming back, and would find the search hadn’t finished yet.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The customer facing interface was extremely complicated and confusing. The company brand had become stale and dated and didn’t
                    refect the company's philosophy.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Securus needed to overhaul everything: the backend software, the frontend code, the visual design, information
                    architecture, and even the branding.
                  </p>

                  <h3>
                    Prototyping in Code.
                  </h3>

                  <div class="placeholder" style="background: url(/work/securus/img/securus-dashboard.jpeg) no-repeat center top; background-size: 95%;height: 420px; border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc;"></div>

                  <p>
                    When I joined the project, the Product team had been struggling to keep pace with the developers. They had been using
                    traditional design tools like Axure, but the developers needed more direct guidance. The team had resorted to
                    designing in code using a pair of now defunct online editors. But the code was only barely usable and the team
                    continued to fall behind.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    I set aside a couple of days to develop my own tool. The result of that spike was a tool I named BFF, a
                    tongue-in-cheek acronym that stood for Barebones Functional Framework. With BFF, we finally caught up to the
                    development team and pushed ahead until we had at least several weeks of backlog for the developers to choose from.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    In addition to building the BFF prototyping tool, I took on others roles over the next year and a half (see below).

                    Building a Design System.

                  <p>
                    The number of teams working on the project grew from one small team with a handful of developers, to four teams: two based out of the Securus office, one based out of Chicago, and another based out of Montreal, with a total of over 30 developers.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    To maintain consistency in the design, and reduce developer frustration, I helped build a design system that was eventually maintained by a dedicated team of designers and developers.
