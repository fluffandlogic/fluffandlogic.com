                        Cocoa is a fictional app based on my experience designing insurance software. The goal is to figure out where
                        insurance software needs to go to appeal to the next generation of insurance agents: Generation Z and beyond. For more
                        details on this project, including context scenarios and other research information, contact me.

                    <h3>
                        Meet Maria.
                    </h3>

                    <div class="placeholder" style="background: url(/work/cocoa/img/photo-maria.jpeg) no-repeat center center; height: 400px;"></div>

                    <p>
                        Maria is a young insurance agent. She’s completed her training and is looking for a way to earn a living as an agent.
                        Maria didn’t choose to become an agent. She did so because there wasn’t enough money coming from freelancing as an
                        Uber driver, or running tasks using Task Rabbit. She wants a more steady source of income. Her mother was an insurance
                        agent and she recommended Maria at least try being an agent. After going through the training she’s ready to at least
                        try being an agent.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Maria wants minimum on-boarding, and maximum productivity from the get-go. She wants a delightful, intuitive, and
                        engaging experience even in a commercial, enterprise app. Maria will not accept sub-par experiences. She demands a
                        higher quality experience.
                    </p>

                    </h3>

                    <h4>
                        Homepage.
                    </h4>

                    <div class="placeholder" style="background: url(/work/cocoa/img/cocoa-dashboard.png) no-repeat center center; background-size: 80%;height: 700px; border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc;"></div>

                    <p>
                        The homepage offers Maria an at-a-glance view of how her business is doing. Insurance agents get paid with commissions
                        and agency fees on premiums from customers. Keeping track of that information vs. the number of claims that are eating
                        into their revenue and profits is an important indicator on how Maria’s agency is doing.
                    </p>

                    <h4>
                        Customer Details.
                    </h4>

                    <div class="placeholder" style="background: url(/work/cocoa/img/cocoa-profile.png) no-repeat center top; background-size: 80%;height: 400px; border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc;"></div>

                    <p>
                        Maria can quickly search for any customer and find out about their policy details, claims history, premiums and other
                        information. The app is built around search. Speed is the key.
                    </p>

                    <h4>
                        Chat With Customers.
                    </h4>

                    <div class="placeholder" style="background: url(/work/cocoa/img/cocoa-chat.png) no-repeat center bottom; background-size: 80%;height: 300px; border-top: 1px solid #ccc;"></div>

                    <p>
                        For an insurance agent like Maria with hundreds of customers, it’s very difficult to remember the last thing a
                        customer might have said weeks or months ago. For Maria’s customer though, that is the thing they remember. And they
                        expect their agent to be able to quick respond based on their last converstaion. The Chat view is a Slack-style
                        interface that lets Maria talk to one customer or dozens, and quickly switch context when a customer asks a question.
                    </p>

                    <h4>
                        Maria’s Todos.
                    </h4>

                    <div class="placeholder" style="background: url(/work/cocoa/img/cocoa-todos.png) no-repeat center bottom; background-size: 80%;height: 600px; border-top: 1px solid #ccc;"></div>

                    <p>
                        Maria has a lot on her mind. Rather than try to juggle hundreds of tasks on pieces of paper or across several apps,
                        Cocoa has a built-in todo manager that helps Maria keep track of her tasks and relate them to the specific customers
                        that they are related to.
