            <div class="intro-text">
                Cocoa was an idea incubation app based on my experience designing insurance software. I wanted to test
                out some ideas regarding where commercial insurance software needed to go to appeal to the next
                generation of insurance agents: Gen Z and beyond.

                        <p>
                            Cocoa was a personal project that I worked on outside of EZLynx. I was frustrated with the lack
                            of progress in commercial insurance software, particularly it's focus on desktop only users.
                            I had my design team do some research into what the next generation of insurance agents would
                            look like. I had also done some competitive research into commercial insurance software.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            EZLynx' software at the time was complex and desktop based, which was fine for an older audience
                            (millenial, Gen X, etc.) but would lose market share over time to newer competitors who were
                            appealing to a younger audience (e.g. Gen Z).
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col">
                        <p>
                            The EZLynx 5 redesign that I had initiated was designed to solve that problem for the personal
                            insurance products on the EZLynx platform: the design was modern, responsive, and far more
                            appealing to a younger audience. The commercial insurance products were still desktop only and
                            were not initially part of the EZLynx 5 redesign.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There was no official roadmap to move the commercial products to EZLynx 5 or to mobile. I felt
                            that this was too important of a problem to ignore, so I decided to explore it on my own time,
                            with the hope that I could incorporate my learnings into future EZLynx commercial insurance
                            projects.

                    <div class="col">
                        <p>
                            I leveraged a lot of the research I had already done up to this point for the
                            various other projects I worked on at EZLynx. To ensure this completed this project, I gave
                            myself a time limit of about 1 month.

                        Maria is a young insurance agent. She’s completed her training and is looking for a way to earn a living as an agent.
                        Maria didn’t choose to become an agent. She did so because there wasn’t enough money coming from freelancing as an
                        Uber driver, or running tasks using Task Rabbit. She wants a more steady source of income. Her mother was an insurance
                        agent and she recommended Maria at least try being an agent. After going through the training she’s ready to at least
                        try being an agent.

                    <p>
                        Maria wants minimum on-boarding, and maximum productivity from the get-go. She wants a delightful, intuitive, and
                        engaging experience even in a commercial, enterprise app. Maria will not accept sub-par experiences. She demands a
                        higher quality experience.

                <p>
                    A typical insurance scenario starts with a customer contacting Maria to request help with insuring
                    their business. I wanted to follow the convention of most messaging apps (Facebook Messenger,
                    WhatsApp, Teams, Slack), where communication from customers are grouped into separate threads.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This allows Maria to see the history of each customer's conversation and offer them better service.

                </h4>
                <p>
                    Since Cocoa is a mobile app, it's tied into the mobile phone's notification system. That means,
                    Cocoa can be notified of any customer request via phone call, text message, or any social media
                    app that can be integrated with Cocoa.

                    New Customer
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Duplicate customer data is a major problem in insurance software. That makes it harder to serve
                    a customer because their data gets scattered across multiple customer records if they leave and
                    return to an agent. Cocoa gets around that by letting Maria search for the customer first, so that
                    if they already exist, they can add the quote to the existing customer.
                </p>

                    I went through several iterations before I arrived at the final designs below. The layout is
                    more spacious open than the typical commercial insurance app. Because I was working on a deadline,
                    I used the Roboto rounded icons.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I went through several names trying to find one that would express the intent that I had for this
                    product. I finally settled on Cocoa, because like the food, this app was designed to give users a
                    shot of energy and excitement. I also wanted a name that was organic vs the cold, techy names
                    usually chosen by insurance software companies.

                            The homepage offers Maria an at-a-glance view of how her business is doing. Insurance agents get paid with commissions
                            and agency fees on premiums from customers. Keeping track of that information vs. the number of claims that are eating
                            into their revenue and profits is an important indicator on how Maria’s agency is doing.

                            information. The app is built around search. Speed is the key.

                        <p>
                            For an insurance agent like Maria with hundreds of customers, it’s very difficult to remember the last thing a
                            customer might have said weeks or months ago. For Maria’s customer though, that is the thing they remember. And they
                            expect their agent to be able to quick respond based on their last converstaion. The Chat view is a Slack-style
                            interface that lets Maria talk to one customer or dozens, and quickly switch context when a customer asks a question.

                            Maria has a lot on her mind. Rather than try to juggle hundreds of tasks on pieces of paper or across several apps,
                            Cocoa has a built-in todo manager that helps Maria keep track of her tasks and relate them to the specific customers
                            that they are related to.

                <p>
                    Throughout my career, I've worked on personal projects to explore problems that my
                    colleagues or my company are experiencing, but for which there isn't any official budget or roadmap.
                    I then apply the lessons from those projects back at work to move the company forward. Cocoa was my
                    attempt to solve the problem of commercial insurance software for the next generation of users. I
                    was able to apply some of these lessons into migrating some of the commercial products to the
                    modern, responsive EZLynx 5 design that I built.
