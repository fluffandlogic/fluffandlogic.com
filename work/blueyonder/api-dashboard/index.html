                <p class="col">
                    One the thirteen scrum teams I supported throughout my time at Blue Yonder was the API Management
                    team. One of the products I built for the team was a dashboard to monitor the health and status
                    of their APIs. Until then, the operations team did not have a single place to monitor the health
                    of their various APIs. Frequently, the team would only find out something was failing when a
                    customer would call and point it out.
                </p>

                <p class="col">
                    The goal of the API Dashboard was to give the API operations team a way to monitor the health
                    of their APIs and surface problems before our customers noticed.

            <h3>
                Kick Off
            </h3>

            <p>
                The kick-off meeting started with a surprise. The team requesting the API dashboard did not know what
                kind of metrics they wanted to see in the dashboard. This was unusual because I would usually
                get the requirements from the product managers and/or subject matter experts before I started a project.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this project, I would have to do my own research into what an operations persona would wanted to
                measure and then develop the requirements from that. I would then have to review them with the
                stakeholders, and iterate over them before starting on ideation.

                For this project, I used the following process.

                Since the Operations team didn't know what they wanted, I had to do some competitive research on the
                web to see what metrics other operations teams captured in their dashboards. The following is a sample
                of the screenshots that I used for reference.

                I analysed the screenshots of the operations dashboards I found to see what kind of metrics they
                measured and what kind of charts they used, and what the articles where I found the screenshots said
                about the various types of metrics. I then broke them down into the following tables.

            <p>
                While I was able to catalog the data, I still wasn't sure what a lot of the metrics meant. I needed
                additional meetings with the stakeholders from the Operations team to make more sense of these
                measurements and to figure out which ones are captured by Blue Yonder, and which ones aren't.
            </p>

            <p>
                One problem I've run into with many, many product and engineering people is that they struggle to
                provide feedback on the more abstract product design artefacts like customer journeys and personas.
                In a lot of cases, I won't get good feedback on features and requirements until I have translated
                them into wireframes or mockups. This was the case with this project as well.
            </p>

            <p>
                When I discussed my
                findings with the Operations team, they weren't able to determine whether the metrics I had selected
                would make for a good set of measurements. I had to distill them into a set of screens with filters
                and charts before I would get useful feedback.

            <p>
                It took several iterations to go from an initial set of very rough charts to the final version below.
                During those iterations, the scope of the project expanded as we added additional filters to allow
                the Operations persona to drill down to a more granular view of the data.

            <p>There were more charts than could fit in the mockups without making them unwieldy to review. So I
                broke out the various charts into widgets and requested the team add a feature to let users
                drag-and-drop charts as needed.</p>

                This project was an example of my ability to take unclear requirements from project owners and
                do the research to be able to provide direction to the project. API metrics was a domain I was
                inexperienced with. The Operations team, by comparison were deep domain experts in this area. Yet the
                team trusted me to do the research and develop a viable solution, one they were happy with in the end.
