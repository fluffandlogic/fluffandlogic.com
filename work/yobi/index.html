                    <h3>About</h3>

                    <p>
                      Yobi is an award-winning AI company based out of Silicon Valley. Yobi's platform harnesses the collaborative power of humans and AI,
                        simplifying operations and empowering teams to drive business growth.
                    </p>

                    <h3>
                      But first, they’re going to need funding.
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                      Back in 2019, Yobi was just an idea. Silicon Valley is awash in incredibly brilliant and hard-working enterpreneurs working on the next big idea.
                      To scale their ideas into million (and billion dollar) companies they need funding from venture capitalists and other investors
                      so they can build a team and start growing. Yobi’s founder, Ahmed Reza, was candid about the problem: to secure much needed
                      investment, the product design and the pitch had to look amazing. That’s where I came in.
                    </p>

                    <h3>
                      The first iteration.
                    </h3>

                    <div class="placeholder" style="background: url(/work/yobi/img/yobi-desktop.png) no-repeat center top; background-size: 95%;height: 420px; border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc;"></div>

                    <p>
                      The first idea for Yobi was a desktop or web app. I was able to use my experience designing intuitive UIs for complex
                      enterprise apps to take the founder's idea and turn it into a first step.
                    </p>

                    <h3>
                      The future is mobile first.
                    </h3>

                    <div class="mobile-first">
                        <div class="thumb"><img src="img/mobile1.png" alt=""></div>
                        <div class="thumb"><img src="img/mobile2.png" alt=""></div>
                        <div class="thumb"><img src="img/mobile3.png" alt=""></div>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                      As the team continued to explore how users would use the app, I referenced some user research I had done over the
                      previous year or so. The world is going mobile first. Most Gen Z and Millenial users are going to spend to spend their
                      time on mbile devices instead of desktops. So we switched from desktop to mobile.
                    </p>

                    <h3>
                      Onboarding has to be dead simple.
                    </h3>

<!--                    <div class="placeholder" style="background: url(/work/yobi/img/yobi-first-time-user.png) no-repeat center top; background-size: 70%;height: 500px; border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc"></div>-->

                    <p>
                      For Yobi to succeed, the onboarding experience has to be as easy as possible. A poor onboarding experience can result
                      in a lot of support calls before the user has even started to use the app, and that can mean angry customers and
                      cancellations. To make sure the Yobi onboarding experience is as painless as possible, I had to match the onboarding
                      experience as closely as possible with the user’s mental model. I did extensive research into various social media
                      apps to understand what users were expecting.
                    </p>

                    <div class="onboarding">
                        <div class="thumb"><img src="img/step1.png" alt=""></div>
                        <div class="thumb"><img src="img/step2.png" alt=""></div>
                        <div class="thumb"><img src="img/step3.png" alt=""></div>
                        <div class="thumb"><img src="img/step4.png" alt=""></div>
                        <div class="thumb"><img src="img/step5.png" alt=""></div>
                        <div class="thumb"><img src="img/step6.png" alt=""></div>
                        <div class="thumb"><img src="img/step7.png" alt=""></div>

                        <div class="thumb"><img src="img/step9.png" alt=""></div>
                    </div>

                    <h3>
                      Next, we need a website. And logo. And identity.
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                      In my experience, a seamless brand experience is key in helping people remember your product. For Yobi, The brand had
                      to be polished so they could create an incredible pitch deck and rise above the other startup pitches. In addition,
                      the founders wanted to get early adopters interested in the product and start signing up. For Yobi, I designed an
                      interim logo, designed the website, and settled on a brand color.

                    <h3>
                        And ... Profit?
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        Ahmed took the newly designed pitch deck with my new product designs to a pitch meeting for seed stage startups looking for funding
                        and made his presentation. His presentation was a success. After the meeting was over, he was approached by a pair of investors who
                        wanted to buy the product. Ahmed was blown away. People wanted to buy his product already, and he hadn't even started building it yet,
                        just on the value of the design alone! That was the impetus that Ahmed needed to start scaling up his operation.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I've continued to work with Ahmed as an unpaid product advisor, helping him build a design system, design the initial product screens,
                        and provide feedback on the Gen AI tools that came out in 2022, including ChatGPT 3.5 and MidJourney.
