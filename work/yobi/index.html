                    <h3>About</h3>

                    <p>
                      Yobi is a seed-stage Silicon Valley startup working on building a platform for small businesses to streamline their
                      social media efforts so they can spend more time making their small businesses awesome. With Yobi, business owners can
                      make phone calls, send and receive text messages, and view all their social media messages in one integrated view,
                      without having to switch between multiple apps.
                    </p>

                    <h3>
                      But first, they’re going to need funding.
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                      Silicon Valley is awash in incredibly brilliant and hard-working enterpreneurs working on the next big idea. To scale
                      their ideas into million (and billion dollar) companies they need funding from venture capitalists and other investors
                      so they can build a team and start growing. Yobi’s founder was candid about the problem: to secure much needed
                      investment, the pitch had to look amazing. That’s where I came in.
                    </p>

                    <h3>
                      The first iteration.
                    </h3>

                    <div class="placeholder" style="background: url(/work/yobi/img/yobi-desktop.png) no-repeat center top; background-size: 95%;height: 420px; border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc;"></div>

                    <p>
                      The first idea for Yobi was a desktop or web app. I was able to use my experience designing intuitive UIs for complex
                      enterprise apps.
                    </p>

                    <h3>
                      The future is mobile first.
                    </h3>

                    <div class="placeholder" style="background: url(/work/yobi/img/yobi-jane-thread-1.png) no-repeat center bottom; background-size: 70%;height: 500px; border-top: 1px solid #ccc"></div>

                    <p>
                      As the team continued to explore how users would use the app, I referenced some user research I had done over the
                      previous year or so. The world is going mobile first. Most Gen Z and Millenial users are going to spend to spend their
                      time on mbile devices instead of desktops. So we switched from desktop to mobile.
                    </p>

                    <h3>
                      Onboarding has to be dead simple.
                    </h3>

                    <div class="placeholder" style="background: url(/work/yobi/img/yobi-first-time-user.png) no-repeat center top; background-size: 70%;height: 500px; border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc"></div>

                    <p>
                      For Yobi to succeed, the onboarding experience has to be as easy as possible. A poor onboarding experience can result
                      in a lot of support calls before the user has even started to use the app, and that can mean angry customers and
                      cancellations. To make sure the Yobi onboarding experience is as painless as possible, I had to match the onboarding
                      experience as closely as possible with the user’s mental model. I did extensive research into various social media
                      apps to understand what users were expecting.
                    </p>

                    <h3>
                      Next, we need a website. And logo. And identity.
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                      In my experience, a seamless brand experience is key in helping people remember your product. For Yobi, The brand had
                      to be polished so they could create an incredible pitch deck and rise above the other startup pitches. In addition,
                      the founders wanted to get early adopters interested in the product and start signing up. For Yobi, I designed an
                      interim logo, designed the website, and settled on a brand color.
                    </p>
