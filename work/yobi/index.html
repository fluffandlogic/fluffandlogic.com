                Yobi is an award-winning AI company based out of Silicon Valley. Yobi's platform harnesses the
                collaborative power of humans and AI, simplifying operations and empowering teams to drive business

                        But first,<br> they’re going<br> to need funding

                    <p>
                        Back in 2019, Yobi was just an idea. Silicon Valley is awash in incredibly brilliant and hard-working
                        enterpreneurs working on the next big idea. To scale their ideas into million (and billion dollar)
                        companies they need funding from venture capitalists and other investors so they can build a team and
                        start growing. Yobi’s founder, Ahmed Reza, was candid about the problem: to secure much needed investment,
                        the product design and the pitch had to look amazing. That’s where I came in.

                    <p>
                        The first idea for Yobi was a desktop or web app. I was able to use my experience designing intuitive UIs for complex
                        enterprise apps to take the founder's idea and turn it into a first step.

                <p>
                    As the team continued to explore how users would use the app, I referenced some user research I had done over the
                    previous year or so. The world is going mobile first. Most Gen Z and Millenial users are going to spend to spend their
                    time on mbile devices instead of desktops. So we switched from desktop to mobile.

                <p>
                    For Yobi to succeed, the onboarding experience has to be as easy as possible.

                    <p>
                        Poor onboarding experience can result in a lot of
                        support calls before the user has even started to
                        use the app, and that can mean angry customers
                        and cancellations.
                    </p>

                <p>
                    To make sure the Yobi onboarding experience is as
                    painless as possible, I had to match the onboarding
                    experience as closely as possible with
                    the user’s mental model.
                </p>

                </div>

                <p>
                    I did extensive research into various social media apps to understand what users were expecting.

                    In my experience, a seamless brand experience is key in helping people remember your product. For Yobi, The brand had
                    to be polished so they could create an incredible pitch deck and rise above the other startup pitches. In addition,
                    the founders wanted to get early adopters interested in the product and start signing up. For Yobi, I designed an
                    interim logo, designed the website, and settled on a brand color.

                <p>
                    Ahmed took the newly designed pitch deck with my new product designs to a pitch meeting for seed stage startups looking for funding
                    and made his presentation. His presentation was a success. After the meeting was over, he was approached by a pair of investors who
                    wanted to buy the product. Ahmed was blown away. People wanted to buy his product already, and he hadn't even started building it yet,
                    just on the value of the design alone! That was the impetus that Ahmed needed to start scaling up his operation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I've continued to work with Ahmed as an unpaid product advisor, helping him build a design system, design the initial product screens,
                    and provide feedback on the Gen AI tools that came out in 2022, including ChatGPT 3.5 and MidJourney.
