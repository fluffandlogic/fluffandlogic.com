    <h3>
      About
    </h3>
    <p>
      This section is still a work in progress. But, if youâ€™re wondering if I can take the most complex enterprise
      workflows and turn them into streamlined, intuitive, interfaces (in this case personal and commercial workflows
      for independent insurance agents), the answer is yes. Yes, I can. For more details on this project, including
      workflows and how many hundreds of mockups, conversations with developers, product managers, product owners, and
      executives I had to have to get to this point, contact me.
    </p>

    <p>
      At EZLynx, I had two roles:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Individual Contributor
      </li>
      <li>
        Design Team Manager
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
      Individual Contributor
    </h3>

    <p>
      The first is as an individual contributor on any project that has a user interface. In that role, I work with the
      Product teams and Developers following a designing thinking approach from concept to execution.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Step 1: Kick Off
    </h4>

    <p>
      Every product at EZLynx starts either at the executive level or with a product manager.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once a product manager has a high level scope, I meet with them to understand their end goals or outcomes of the
      project and learn what they already know e.g. pain points, users, feedback on existing products, competitiors, etc.
    </p>
